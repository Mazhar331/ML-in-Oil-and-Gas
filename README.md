# ML-in-Oil-and-Gas
- Data from the Volve Oilfield was used to create Machine Learning (ML) models.
- Tree-based models were built to predict Sonic Logs and Well Drilling Rates.
- A Long Short-Term Memory model was built to forecast oil and gas production.
- Different algorithms, and continuous and batch learning workflows were experimented with.
- The report and presentation files establish the project's backgroound and scope, discuss model perfomance and results, and suggest future work.
